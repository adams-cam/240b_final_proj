Final project for UC Berkeley PB HLTH C240B in Fall 2020

Longitudinal targeted learning using causal methodology.

For this final project I did a reanalysis of the data used in the following article: 

Lee YY, Kim TJ, Kim JY, et al. Genetic profiling to predict recurrence of early   cervical cancer. Gynecol Oncol. Gynecol Oncol; 2013;131:650â€“654. 

The goal of the above article was to identify genes that are predictive of tumor recurrence following treatment among women with cervical cancer.

Details of the project included method and results are presented in **final_presentation.pdf**.
